## Overview

**EventPlanner** is a web-based platform built for event organizers to manage and sell event tickets seamlessly. Designed specifically for professional planners, the application supports multi-category ticketing (e.g., VIP, Regular, Early Bird), secure online payments, and automated ticket delivery via email with QR codes for validation.

It includes:

- Role-based access (only verified planners can create events)
- Dynamic ticket creation with pricing and quantity control
- Payment integration (Paystack)
- Ticket issuance with unique codes and QR verification
- Admin dashboard for managing orders, users, and events
- Webhook support for secure transaction validation

The goal is to provide a production-ready backend that mimics real-world event management systems, complete with authentication, validation, job queues, and caching layers.
